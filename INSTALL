#Building and installing RPH Tools

## Building RPH Tools
Run either the PowerShell script build.ps1 or the BAT script build.bat.

If you run the PowerShell script, the command ```Set-ExecutionPolicy``` must be
ran with the attribute ```AllSigned```, ```RemoteSigned```, or ```Unrestricted```.

Both will output rph_tools.js. This is the script that is needed to be imported
into Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey.

## Installing RPH Tools
1. You must have (one or the other)
  - [Firefox](http://www.getfirefox.com) with the [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) extension installed
  - [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Chromium](http://www.chromium.org/Home) with the [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) extension installed.
2. Install using one of these two methods:
  - Go to the [Openuser JS site](https://openuserjs.org/scripts/shuffyiosys/RPH_Tools) and click on the "Install" button on top to add the script.
  - Click on the "Source Code" tab and copy the source code, then...
    - In Greasemonkey, select "Add new script", enter some information then press OK, then paste the code in there. Make sure to save it and enable it.
    - In Tampermonkey, select "Add a new script", then paste the code in there. Press the save icon and enable it.
5. Refresh RPH if you're on it already for the script to take effect.

##Updating RPH Tools
Go to the [Openuser JS site](https://openuserjs.org/scripts/shuffyiosys/RPH_Tools) and click on the "Install" button on top to update the script. This will overwrite the version you currently have.
