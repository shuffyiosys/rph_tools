####How to Install and Update
1. You must have (one or the other)
  - [Firefox](http://www.getfirefox.com) with the [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) extension installed
  - [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Chromium](http://www.chromium.org/Home) with the [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) extension installed.
2. **For Google Chrome users:** Google Chrome by default does not allow installation of custom user scripts unless you either bypass it or they're on the Chrome store. To bypass this, follow [these instructions](http://techsupportguides.com/install-userscripts-in-chrome/) (that's a link).
3. If you have a previous version, you should remove it.
4. Then... 
  - Click on the "Install" button on top to add the script or...
  - Click on the "Source Code" tab and copy the source code, then...
    - In Greasemonkey, select "Add new script", enter some information then press OK, then paste the code in there. Make sure to save it and enable it.
    - In Tampermonkey, select "Add a new script", then paste the code in there. Press the save icon and enable it.
5. Refresh RPH if you're on it already for the script to take effect.

**To update**
Just press the "install" button. This will overwrite the version you currently have.
